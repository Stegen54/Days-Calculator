First Import the datetime module so you can get the present date.
# import the datetime module to work with dates

Get the exact date of today using the datetime module you imported
# Get the current date

# Print a welcome message so the user would understand what the program is about.
# Get input from a user, Asking the user to enter their age.

# Convert the age to an integer value

# Calculate the number of days the person has lived
# use 365.25 to represent a year  taking into account leap years

# Print the appropriate result with a text that makes it more understandable.

Bonus: You can check for errors in case the user inputs a value other than an integer. (Prompt the user to input a string instead of the program crashing)
