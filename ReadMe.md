# You will be writing your code in the Starter.py file


# First Import the datetime module so you can get the present date.
# import the datetime module to work with dates

# Get the exact date of today using the datetime module you imported
# Get the current date

# Print a welcome message so the user would understand what the program is about.
# Get input from a user, Asking the user to enter their age.

# Convert the age to an integer value

# Calculate the number of days the person has lived
# use 365.25 to represent a year  taking into account leap years

# Print the appropriate result with a text that makes it more understandable.

# Bonus: You can check for errors in case the user inputs a value other than an integer. (Prompt the user to input a string instead of the program crashing)
# The image expected.png has the expected output if you've successfully completed the project.
# The completed project should take in an input from the user and give the number of days the user has spent on earth based on the number the user has spent on earth
